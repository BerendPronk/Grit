# Grit
A free open-source CSS grid, up to 24 columns

This is a simple CSS grid with unique layouts options for devices with a screen width under and over 768px.

How to use
-

1. Add the classname 'r' to an element to let the browser know it is a row, rows contain one or more columns.
2. Classname 'c' tells the browser that the element should be treated as a column.
3. Column widths for devices with a higher width than 768px should start with a 'd', for DESKTOP.
*Example: d-2-5 (two-fifths)*
4. The same rule goes for devices with a width under 768px. They should start with a 'm', for MOBILE.
*Example: m-5-5 (five-fifths, or full width)*
5. The full classname for a responsive column should look like '{column} d-{value}-{value} m-{value}-{value}'.*Example: 'c d-2-5 m-5-5'*
